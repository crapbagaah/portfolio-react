                        During my internship, I maintained a sincere and dedicated approach to my responsibilities. One of the significant projects I worked on was creating a stable chat interface for the internal NLP team focusing on Reactjs as the main framework along Typescript and Context API, where I focused on ensuring reliability and usability.

                        <br />
                        I had the opportunity to contribute to a life sciences project by developing automated scripts, emphasizing efficiency and problem-solving. I had the chance to revamp my team's tools website, which featured over 30 tools.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In summary, my internship journey has been marked by a sincere commitment to delivering reliable solutions and enhancing user experiences. Moving forward, I am excited to continue leveraging these experiences to contribute effectively and make a positive impact in future projects.
